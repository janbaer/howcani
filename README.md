# HowCanI 2

This project contains the source code for my HowCanI project. It's a rewrite of the original version which I developed a few years ago with using AngularJS.
But because it's time to try something new I decided to use Svelte instead.

## how to deploy a new version

```
git tag -a 3.2.6 -m "3.2.66 - Fix wrong domain name in CNAME" && git push --tags
```
